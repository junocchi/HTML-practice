      I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too?<br />
      Then there's a pair of us!<br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />
      How public - like a Frog -<br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br />
      To an admiring Bog!<br />
